# LadyBug Movement - Event Listener

This project demonstrates how to use JavaScript event listeners to move an element (LadyBug) in four directions: **up**, **down**, **left**, and **right** by clicking on arrow key buttons.

## Features

- **Event Listener**: Listens for `click` events to detect button clicks.
- **Movement**: Moves the LadyBug element across the screen in the specified direction.
- **Simple and Clean UI**: Minimal HTML and CSS to focus on the JavaScript logic.

## How It Works

When the user clciks the arrow keys:

- **Up Arrow**: Moves the LadyBug up.
- **Down Arrow**: Moves the LadyBug down.
- **Left Arrow**: Moves the LadyBug left.
- **Right Arrow**: Moves the LadyBug right.
